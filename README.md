## Data Analysis for The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) Collection

This project uses the MoMA's public dataset ( from Kaggle) to develop an understanding of the MoMA's artwork and artists.

## Overview
In this project we are trying to understand the MoMA's collection according to artworks , artists, demographics, gender etc.

## Data
The data used is taken from the Museum of Modern Art data on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/momanyc/museum-collection

# Context
The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) acquired its first artworks in 1929, the year it was established. Today, the Museum’s evolving collection contains almost 200,000 works from around the world spanning the last 150 years. The collection includes an ever-expanding range of visual expression, including painting, sculpture, printmaking, drawing, photography, architecture, design, film, and media and performance art.

# Content
MoMA is committed to helping everyone understand, enjoy, and use our collection. The Museum’s website features 72,706 artworks from 20,956 artists. The artworks dataset contains 130,262 records, representing all of the works that have been accessioned into MoMA’s collection and cataloged in our database. It includes basic metadata for each work, including title, artist, date, medium, dimensions, and date acquired by the Museum. Some of these records have incomplete information and are noted as “not curator approved.” The artists dataset contains 15,091 records, representing all the artists who have work in MoMA's collection and have been cataloged in our database. It includes basic metadata for each artist, including name, nationality, gender, birth year, and death year.
